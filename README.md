## Devlogs
### W1
#### Activity 1
Going to office hour and ask questions, even you don't have any questions do your homework outside the office once you have a question you can just going in and ask for help, or maybe you don't have questions just letting professor help you do a play test, I think this is very very helpful. Table 5.
#### Activity 2
1. 10
2. 2
3. everytime you have a new thing, in Debug.Log will show "hello world".
4. MonoBehaviour
5. In these lines it introduce the Start method, and the method include PrintMessage(10) is a definition, inside this define  "x = " is string so these line will show x = 10 which made PrintMessage become a method.
6. 10 is a parameter. ("x = " + 10) is a agruement.
7. Transform.Translate(_direction); is wrong. we called the class name.
8. change Transform to _playerTransform.
